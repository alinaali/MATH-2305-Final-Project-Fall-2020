    Parameters
    ----------
    graph = list
    v = starting verticy of the subtree
    
    function
    --------
    This function helps helps us catch any verticy errors if the user enters or searches for a 
    starting verticy that doesn't exist in the graph. If the verticy exists it will execute the ''else'' statement
    returning a subgraph starting at the requested verticy, but if it doesn't exist, then it executes the ''if'' statement 
    returning an error message.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph = original graph/ reference graph
    subgraph = subtree of original graph. this is the minimum spanning tree
    
    function
    --------
    This function is to help us find out if the subtree is spanning. When we say spanning, it means that the subtree
    is able to contain all the vertices from the parent graph without holding all the same edges. If the subtree matches
    the same vertices with it's parent graph the this function will return false. This is used as a limiter in
    the algorithm's while loop

    ---------
    This function is used to help us find the cost of an edge. It takes the the two vertices that create the edge
