**Explanation of Prim's Algorithm**

In Computer Science, Prim's (otherwise called Jarn√≠k's) algorithm is a greedy calculation that finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph. This means that it finds a subset of the edges which shapes a tree that incorporates each vertex, where the weight or "cost" of the relative multitude of edges in the tree is the least possible. Prim's algorithm includes the following steps/restrictions:
- Selects a random node to begin
- Checks all the outgoing edge(s) of that node
- Picks the edge with the least or minimum cost to move through
- No cycles are allowed
- All vertices must be connected in the end
